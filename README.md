# pyWalNeopixels
## BEFORE USE
Before anything in this repo will work for you, you must install CircuitPython libraries on your raspberry pi according to [this guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/installing-circuitpython-on-raspberry-pi), and then in your raspberry pi's terminal run:
```sudo pip3 install rpi_ws281x adafruit-circuitpython-neopixel```
This must be done with python 3, as python 2.X will not work. If python3 is your default python, you may need to run the same command with ```pip``` instead.

You must also change the directory variables to match your configuration.
